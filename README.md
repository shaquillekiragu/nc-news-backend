In order to successfully connect to the two databases locally, you need to create the files ".env.test" and ".env.development" at the root of your repository.

When you have done this, copy the example variable in the existing .env-example file, and paste them into the created files above, replacing the variable value "database_name_here" with "nc_news_test" in .env.test, and with "nc_news_development" in .env.development.
